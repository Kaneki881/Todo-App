Database: MongoDB
Installation:

(Optional) PORT: Port on which the server will listen (defaults to 5000)
Ensure you have MongoDB running and a database accessible.

Use API endpoints for todo management:

Create a new todo: POST /api/todos (with Content-Type: application/json and todo data in request body)
Get a specific todo: GET /api/todos/:id
Update a todo: PUT /api/todos/:id (with Content-Type: application/json and updated todo data in request body)
Delete a todo: DELETE /api/todos/:id
User authentication:
Register a new user: POST /api/users (with Content-Type: application/json and user data in request body)
Login an existing user: POST /api/users/login (with Content-Type: application/json and user credentials in request body)
Secure routes require an authorization header with a valid JWT token: Bearer {your_jwt_token}
